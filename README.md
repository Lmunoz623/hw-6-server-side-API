# hw-6-server-side-API
A homework demo using a weather based server side API in order to create a responsive weather dashboard.


## Project Summary
Created a weather dashboard to display current and forecasted weather data. The data is pulled using an API called api.openweathermap.org. Information is displayed when the user searched by city name and clicks the search button. When the user returns to the webpage after closing it, the weather for the last city searched auto populates.
